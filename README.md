# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-EDA-project
An investigatory analysis in order to answer the question; "Are Customers with higher charges more prone to churn?" 

This project is based on Exploratory Data Analysis. The data had been collected from one Orange S.A. which is a French telecom company.
Through this project, the author has attempted to answer the question; "Are Customers with higher charges more prone to churn?"
In order to answer this question, several techniques were used which include; Tukey's 5 number summary, histograms, probability density functions,
cumulative distribution functions, relative risk, permutation test (hypothesis testing), and effect size. 

Python programming language has been used in the making of this project. Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Collections packages 
have been employed. A complete descripton has been provided by means of a .pdf file in the repository.
